🎨 Monet Style Transfer (CycleGAN)

This project transforms ordinary images into Claude Monet–style paintings using a CycleGAN-based neural network trained on the Monet dataset.
Think of it as an AI-powered artistic filter — upload a photo, or use your webcam to take one, and the model reimagines it in Monet’s dreamy, impressionist style!
